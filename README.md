## Introduction
<p>Hey everyone, üñê welcome to my Nextjs blog project. Here is the idea, I followed Max on Udemy to learn Nextjs a couple of month ago. Then I tweaked one of the projects in the course by adding social media login/signup and also by restyling the project by Tailwind CSS. It is a lot of fun.</p>

## Stack
<p>The stack: MongoDB, Express, Nextjs, Node.js. Next-Auth for email/password login and social media login(Github, Gmail, Twitter). </p>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Seond, create ```.env``` file and add your own credentials.
```
MONGODB_URL = 

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = 
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = 

FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID = 
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET = 

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET =

NEXTAUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000            //For development environment. When the application deploy to Vercel, change it to the production URL.

TWITTER_CLIENT_ID = 
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET = 
```

<p>Here is the demo. üëâ<strong>https://next-blog-delta-five.vercel.app/</strong></p>
